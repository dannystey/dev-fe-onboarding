# Welcome!

Hello and welcome, fellow Frontend-Dev, at Virtual Identity.

We, your new colleagues, created this Wiki to give you a guided start during your first weeks.

We wish you a lot of fun working with us!

> NOTE: Maybe an overview of all links that are important to collaborate with VI

> I would change the categorization of topics and put the step `Roadmap & Goals` in front of `Getting started`. So that the onboarder has the goals always presentable. and if its a own page its also printable.

> Would integreate a FAQ Section or more Notes for describing the context
