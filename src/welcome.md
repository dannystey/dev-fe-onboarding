?> *TODO* Maybe an overview of all links that are important to collaborate with VI

?> *TODO* I would change the categorization of topics and put the step `Roadmap & Goals` in front of `Getting started`. So that the onboarder has the goals always presentable. and if its a own page its also printable.

?> *TODO* Would integreate a FAQ Section or more Notes for describing the context

?> *SUGGESTION* Badge System for each level or challenge   

?> *TODO* Could add [medium-zoom](https://docsify.now.sh/plugins?id=zoom-image)
